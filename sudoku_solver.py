# 1) Clearly outline what your Sudoku solver project should achieve. 
#    Specify the features, including the solver algorithm, GUI components, and any additional functionalities.

# 2) Design the sud0ku_s0lver algorithm. 
#   function solveSudoku(board):
#     if the board is filled:
#         return True  # Puzzle is solved
#     for each empty cell (row, col) on the board:
#         for each digit in 1 to 9:
#             if digit is valid in (row, col):
#                 place digit in (row, col)
#                 if solveSudoku(board) is True:
#                     return True  # Puzzle is solved
#                 remove digit from (row, col)
#     return False  # Backtrack if no valid digit found
              
# 3) Implement The GUI Using Tkinter.
#   import tkinter as tk

# class SudokuGUI:
#     def __init__(self, master):
#         self.master = master
#         self.master.title("Sudoku Solver")
#         self.create_widgets()

#     def create_widgets(self):
#         # Create GUI elements (buttons, labels, canvas)
#         # Define event handlers for user interactions
#         # Implement Sudoku grid representation in the GUI
      
# 4) Integrate The Solver With GUI.
#    Link the Sudoku solver algorithm with the GUI. 
#    Define functions to handle user input, trigger the solver, and update the GUI to reflect the solving process.

# 5) Create A Puzzle Generator. 
#    Implement a puzzle generator to create Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. Ensure that generated puzzles are solvable.

# 6) Enhance the GUI to visually represent the solving process. 
#    Highlight the cells being considered, animate the algorithm steps, and update the grid accordingly.

# 7) Allow users to input Sudoku puzzles, trigger the solving process, and interact with the GUI. 
#    Implement features like pausing or stepping through the solving process.

# 8) Test the Sudoku solver with various puzzles, ensuring correct solutions. 
#    Perform unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire system.
