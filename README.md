## Introduction

This project aims to provide a Sudoku solver with an interactive GUI. The solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. The GUI, implemented using Tkinter, allows users to input puzzles, trigger the solving process, and visualize each the solution.

## Features

- Sudoku solver algorithm with backtracking
- Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction
- Visual representation of the solving process

## Algorithm

The Sudoku solver algorithm uses a backtracking approach to explore possible solutions. Pseudocode for the solver can be found in the [Algorithm](#algorithm) section.

## GUI

The graphical user interface is implemented using Tkinter, providing users with an interactive platform to input Sudoku puzzles, trigger the solving process, and visualize the result.


## Visualization

The GUI features visualization of the backtracking algrotihms efficiency.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku solver:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fletxcher/sud0ku_s0lver.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sud0ku_s0lver`
3. Run the solver: `python src/main.py`
